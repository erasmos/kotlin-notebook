# Kotlin Notebook

A hopefully handy reference consisting of test-based demos of various aspects of Kotlin.

If you're using IntelliJ, you'll need to
install [the plugin for Kotest](https://kotest.io/docs/intellij/intellij-plugin.html).

Please note that the domain is not exactly as I'd like it, as I had to bend it to cover certain aspects - for examples:
vars,
where I would have preferred to remain immutable.

## Tests

```
 ./gradlew test
 ```

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, I'd be grateful if you'd add an issue to [this repo](https://github.com/erasmos/kotlin-notebook) - or even a PR, which I'll be glad to
review.

## Acknowledgements

My introduction to Kotlin owes much if not everything to the high quality tutorials from [Rock The JVM](https://rockthejvm.com/), namely:
[Kotlin at Light Speed](https://rockthejvm.com/p/kotlin-at-light-speed), [Kotlin Essentials](https://rockthejvm.com/p/kotlin-essentials)
and [Advanced Kotlin](https://rockthejvm.com/p/advanced-kotlin). Highly recommended, all. And note that [the first](https://rockthejvm.com/p/kotlin-at-light-speed) is free.
